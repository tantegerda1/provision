Purpose
=======

Provides a collection of reusable `shell provisioner scripts <https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/shell.html>`_ 
for `vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`_. These scripts are kept
very generic and as unobtrusive as possible. To be usable, they must
be accompanied by further project-specific provisioners that 
*configure* things.
